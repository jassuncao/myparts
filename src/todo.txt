New name: Pile of Parts

=== To Do ===

* Support for BOMs
It should be possible to do basic BOM management.
See this link for ideas: http://hackaday.com/2014/01/09/a-simple-and-dirty-bill-of-materials-and-stock-management-utility/
Generate a report of parts to purchase by distributor.

* Lookup part in octopart
Based on a user action, the part name is looked up in octopart and the user can choose to import additional data from there.

=== Doing ===

* Support Projects. A project has name, description, remarks/notes, parts and attachments.
Each part entry has the following fields: refDes, quantity, part, remarks.
It would be nice to import from Kicad or from a CSV file.

* In the projects parts, add a widget to make the association to an existing part easier

* There is a latent performance issue in project parts. The part relation will cause a select of all the parts into memory

=== Done ===
* Footprint attachments
* Handle PartDialog "next action" checkbox. -> Need to intercept the accept slot();
* Duplicate part
* Support Distributors
* Quick add resistor wizard
* Implementing support for fractions in UnitParser
* Multiple Storage generator
