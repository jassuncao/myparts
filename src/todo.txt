=== To Do ===
* Support Projects. A project has name, description, remarks/notes, parts and attachments.
Each part entry has the following fields: refDes, quantity, part, remarks.
It would be nice to import from Kicad or from a CSV file.

* Support for BOMs
It should be possible to do basic BOM management.
